        <h6>Part One: The Six Signs</h6>
        <h2>6 Signs Your Nonprofit is Well-Positioned to Start a Social Enterprise</h2>
        <p>Nonprofits have pursued entrepreneurial revenue streams for decades, with organizations like Goodwill Industries and The Girl Scouts first pioneering earned income models that supported their social mission. As conversations about social innovation and social enterprise have increased, many nonprofits are now wondering if they should consider launching an entrepreneurial venture to diversify their funding. Perhaps you’ve been wondering if it’s a path that makes sense for your nonprofit.</p>

        <p>After all, earning unrestricted cash can enable your organization to flexibly try out new programs, reach new beneficiaries, and sustain your core work, even in uncertain financial times.</p> 

        <p>That said, developing a social enterprise is not a silver bullet or an easy journey. Like any entrepreneurial venture, pursuing an earned income stream for your nonprofit comes with considerable risk. So when should you take on this challenge?</p> 

        <p>Below are six signs that your nonprofit may be well- positioned to start a social enterprise.</p>

        <h3>1. Your nonprofit leadership team supports the idea of social enterprise</h3>

        <section class="pa--text-indent">
          <p>Turning a social enterprise idea into a profitable revenue stream that adds to your nonprofit’s bottom line will not happen by accident. Your social enterprise strategy needs to be more than a side project that one individual person is pursuing; you need to have buy-in from the top, early on.</p>

          <p>Ask yourself, who is championing the idea of social enterprise in your organization right now?</p>

          <p>If the conversation does not yet involve key decision makers, it is time to get them involved. When a nonprofit leadership team champions social enterprise, it sends a message that developing these entrepreneurial projects is not just a passing fad, but a core element of the strategic plan.</p>

          <p>On the flip side, if your nonprofit leadership team is on board but social enterprise is not well-understood by the rest of the staff, it is helpful to socialize the concept more broadly. You could bring in a speaker to introduce social enterprise at your next team gathering, or put a call out to form a working group and get more people involved in the conversation.</p>

          <img class="pa--dropshadow" src="img/social-entreprenur-expert-speaking-nonprofit.jpg" alt="A social entrepreneurship expert speaking on stage to a group of nonprofits">

          <p>We have seen many nonprofits and companies take the +Acumen course on “Social Entrepreneurship 101” with their teams to introduce a broader range of people to entrepreneurial concepts. We’ve found that, for nonprofit employees in particular, it helps to share case studies from other organizations that have successfully piloted earned income streams without divesting from their core social mission. Often the strongest examples of nonprofit-run social ventures directly support the mission. For example, an assisted living nonprofit for seniors might design software to improve caregiver communication that can then be sold to other related organizations.</p>

          <p>Many nonprofit employees have gotten into their fields because they care deeply about the social impact of their work and can get wary when discussions of profits and revenue are suddenly introduced. You can mitigate these fears by sharing real stories of other nonprofits that have navigated these challenges effectively.</p>

          <p>Bringing together leadership and employees from all levels of the organization early in the process will promote a greater sense of engagement and ownership. If your nonprofit already has a fairly entrepreneurial culture, introducing and gaining buy-in for a new social enterprise strategy might come naturally. </p> 
        </section>

        <h3>2. Your nonprofit is resilient in uncertain times</h3>

        <section class="pa--text-indent">
          <p>Starting a new social venture will inevitably come with many unknowns that need to be navigated on the fly.</p>

          <p>One constant of entrepreneurship is that things are always changing. Shifting political environments, evolving customer needs, and other factors outside your control will impact how well your business does at any given moment. For example, if your nonprofit sells textbooks to subsidize your education programs, how do you react to the trend towards digital materials?</p>

          <p>As much as you plan for and seek to mitigate risks, the unexpected will occur, and your organization’s ability to evolve and make decisions in these uncertain times is key to success.</p>

          <p>This was the case for social enterprise Liberty & Justice, that faced a shock in 2014 when Ebola landed in the very same location as their factory right after they had secured  two contracts worth $40 million dollars. Thanks to a resilient and adaptable team they were able to come out of the crisis ahead.</p>

          </section>

        <h3>3. You already have the relevant talent, or are willing to invest in growing it</h3>

        <section class="pa--text-indent">
          <p>Nonprofits that have the most success with social enterprise realize they need leaders and staff with relevant business experience at all levels of the organization.</p>

          <p>It’s ideal to have team members with general entrepreneurial experience to drive the initiative forward in early stages, and later to bring on people with industry-specific experience.</p>

          <p>Imagine a family member came to you with a new restaurant idea looking for investment. Would you risk your hard-earned savings if they said they had no chef and no one on the team who had ever planned or priced a menu, purchased from food suppliers, or recruited, trained or scheduled staff? It would be a nightmare!</p>

          <blockquote>Although you might already have staff who are enthusiastic about the new venture, ask yourself if the group that is moving the idea forward is missing key skills.
          </blockquote>

          <p>The same is true if your nonprofit plans to open a restaurant to bring in earned revenue and support your mission (which could be something like training ex-incarcerated individuals so they can go on to gain long term employment).</p>

          <p>Although you might already have staff who are enthusiastic about the new venture, ask yourself if the group that is moving the idea forward is missing key skills. If so, this will need to be addressed sooner than later. We often see that nonprofits have staff who are great experts on the issues they are tackling (such as hunger, homelessness, or environmental conservation), but when it comes to sales, marketing, and business strategy, they might need to bring in new people to complement their skills.</p>

          <p>As the vision for your earned income stream comes together, bring in people with experience in that specific role or industry so that they can help your team take your ideas to the next level.</p>

        <h3>4. You can take calculated risks without jeopardizing your organization.</h3>

        <section class="pa--text-indent">
          <p>Piloting a social enterprise model will likely take your nonprofit out of its comfort zone. Stretching into this new territory will come with risk. Your organization will likely invest both time and resources not only once you start implementing, but also to get to that point.</p>

          <p>You can greatly reduce these risks by tapping into existing knowledge and seeking mentors as you plan out and put your social enterprise idea into action. But if your nonprofit’s resources are already spread so thin that a misstep will result in dire consequences, then pursuing social enterprise is going to be a stressful way to go. In this case, switching gears to secure some more stable and predictable funding before turning back to social enterprise will be more prudent.</p>

          <blockquote>Your nonprofit staff and board members should go into social enterprise development with eyes wide open to the uncertainties and liabilities</blockquote>


          <p>There are four main types of risks that new ventures face--and nonprofit ventures will face them too.</p>

          <p>Harvard Business Review describes these risks as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="pa--li">Demand risk (how likely your customers are to adopt your solution)</li>
            <li class="pa--li">Technology risk (when the solution uses new technology)</li>
            <li class="pa--li">Execution risk (how likely you can pull together the team and partners needed to implement your idea)</li>
            <li class="pa--li">Financing risk (access to funding)</li>
          </ul>
           <p>
            They add, “the entrepreneur’s task is to manage this uncertainty, while recognizing that certain risks cannot be influenced by their actions.”
           </p>

          <p>All this to say, the risk of failure is baked into business. Your nonprofit staff and board members should go into social enterprise development with eyes wide open to the uncertainties and liabilities.</p>

        <h3>5. You see an opportunity to fill a gap in the market, or you are willing to explore until you find one</h3>

     

       

      <section class="pa--text-indent">
        <p>Perhaps the biggest potential downfall of any new business is missing the mark on product-market fit.</p>

        <p>The surest way to guarantee a hard uphill battle is to put out into the world an offer that your target market doesn’t care enough about, or simply doesn’t want.</p>

        <p>One promising way to avoid this situation is to look for the gaps in service you see your existing beneficiaries facing. This will indicate that there could be a genuine need for a new offering. Then, you need to test whether there is willingness to pay for that new offering. If you have a hunch there’s a way to monetize it - you are in a great position!</p>

        <p>Let’s be clear, you don’t need to have your social enterprise idea completely figured out before starting, but you do need to put a healthy focus on rigorously exploring who you desire to serve, what will make a difference for them, and whether they will be able to pay for the product or service. You should also plan for plenty of testing and refining in the early stages.</p>

        <p>One of our most popular free courses at +Acumen, Introduction to Human Centred Design, teaches learners to use design thinking to understand potential customers in a way that allows you to create better solutions for their challenges.</p>

You don’t need to disrupt an industry with a breakthrough innovation.

            <p>When it comes to evolving business models Qasim Qasi, Acumen Fellow and founder of Amden, a Pakistan-based revolving livestock model similar to microfinancing, has experienced it first hand. He shares how the turning point from grant-seeking NGO to for-profit social enterprise began with an impact study 3 years in. Even though Amden’s model was already primed to scale with earned income, the intention of focusing on financial sustainability in the last 4 years brought forward new improvements.</p>

            <p>Amden’s model for eradicating chronic poverty is to transfer livestock to families, and during 18 months collect back a number of goats and poultry birds after the flock has grown. They transfer 3 goats and 10 poultry birds, and during 18 months (on a quarterly basis) they recover the offspring, typically 5 goats and 15 birds or 750 eggs. Since the asset is livestock, not cash, recovering these offspring is what repayment of principal and interest is to cash microfinancing.</p>

            <p>Since focusing on financial sustainability starting in 2014, Amden added a comprehensive training program running beside microfinance for families to learn how to maintain the health of livestock, get maximum breeding, and how to run it like a business and grow into a modern agriculture entrepreneur.</p>

      <h3>6. You are open to new approaches and doing things differently</h3>

      <section class="pa--text-indent">
        <p>It can be quite a shift to look at challenges through an entrepreneurial lens rather than the more traditional charitable lens you may have used in the past. Starting a social enterprise will challenge your staff, teams, and culture in new ways.</p>

        <p>Being open to testing new approaches and learning new skills along the way will allow you to ride the waves of entrepreneurship.</p>

        <blockquote>The truth is you may never feel 100% ready… and that’s okay because it means your risk mitigation gene is turned on!</blockquote>

        <p>Your social enterprise endeavour might require reframing mindsets or beliefs around what it means to sell and earn money, how to use lean methodology approaches to take your idea to market, or how to work smarter, not harder with a systems approach.</p>

        <p>You can expect to trade grant applications and slow turnaround times for testing and continuous iteration to nail your offer and business model.</p>

        <p>The more nimble and open your team is to make decisions with imperfect information, the quicker you will solidify an earned-income strategy that not only brings in consistent revenue, but also contributes to the bottom line.</p>

        <p>If you can see your nonprofit adopting or embodying these six characteristics, you are likely as ready as you’ll ever be to start building out your social enterprise idea. (The truth is you may never feel 100% ready… and that’s okay because it means your risk mitigation gene is turned on!)</p>

        <p>The next step will be to start navigating the windy path of launching a social enterprise - a path that will have you determining what idea will work best for you, planning out your business model and strategy, and finally putting that plan into action!</p>

        <p>Our best advice if you are setting out on this road is to surround yourself with the mentors and peers who can help you navigate through the inevitable twists and turns.</p>
